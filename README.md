# News App

## Overview

This Android application provides users with up-to-date news articles, personalized recommendations, and the ability to save favorite articles. Built using Kotlin and following MVVM architecture, it demonstrates best practices in Android development.

## Features

- Fetch top headlines from various countries and categories
- Search for specific news articles
- Save and manage favorite articles
- Receive personalized news recommendations
- Offline support for viewing previously loaded articles

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and uses the following components:

- **Retrofit**: For making API calls to the News API
- **Room**: For local database storage
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous programming
- **LiveData**: For reactive data handling
- **ViewModel**: For managing UI-related data
- **Glide**: For efficient image loading

## Project Structure

- `NewsApiService.kt`: Defines the API endpoints using Retrofit
- `NewsRepository.kt`: Manages data operations between the API and local database
- `NewsViewModel.kt`: Handles the business logic and provides data to the UI
- `NewsFragment.kt`: Displays the list of news articles
- `NewsAdapter.kt`: RecyclerView adapter for rendering news articles
- `NewsDao.kt`: Data Access Object for Room database operations
- `Article.kt`: Data class representing a news article

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Add your News API key in the appropriate configuration file
4. Build and run the application

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication
- Add more personalization options
- Enhance the UI with material design components
- Implement caching strategies for improved offline performance
- Add unit and integration tests
